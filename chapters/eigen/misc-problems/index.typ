In this section, we prove a few results regarding eigenvalues and eigenvectors. The following definitions and problems are from Bing while the solutions, unless otherwise mentioned, attribute to the authors of this set of notes.

=== Definitions

#definition[
  *Eigenvalue and eigenvector.*

  Let $A$ be an $n times n$ matrix with entries in $CC$.
  A scalar $lambda in CC$ is called an *eigenvalue* of $A$ if there exists a nonzero vector
  $x in CC^n$ such that

  $
    A x = lambda x.
  $

  Any such nonzero vector $x$ is called an *eigenvector* of $A$
  corresponding to the eigenvalue $lambda$.
]

#definition[
  *Hermitian matrix.*

  An $n times n$ matrix $A$ with complex entries is called *Hermitian* if

  $
    A = A^*,
  $

  where $A^* = overline(A)^T$ denotes the conjugate transpose.
]

#definition[
  *Skew-Hermitian matrix.*

  An $n times n$ matrix $A$ with complex entries is called *skew-Hermitian* if

  $
    A^* = -A.
  $
]

#definition[
  *Unitary matrix.*

  An $n times n$ matrix $U$ with complex entries is called *unitary* if

  $
    U^* U = U U^* = I,
  $

  equivalently,

  $
    U^* = U^(-1).
  $
]

#definition[
  *Normal matrix.*

  A matrix $A$ is called *normal* if

  $
    A A^* = A^* A.
  $

  (Hermitian, skew-Hermitian, and unitary matrices are all special cases of normal matrices.)

=== Problems and Solutions

#problem[
  Prove that all eigenvalues of $A$ are real if $A$ is Hermitian.
]
#solution[
  This result is documented in @sec:sym as @thm:eigensym.

  In short, the proof bases on $ lambda vb(x)^* vb(x) = vb(x^* A x) = (vb(x)^* vb(A x))^* = overline(lambda) vb(x)^* vb(x). $ This is true for any eigenvector $vb(x)$ and is by definition non-zero, so $ lambda = overline(lambda) ==> lambda in RR.#qedhere $
]

#problem[
  (a) Prove that if $x$ and $y$ are eigenvectors of a Hermitian matrix $A$
  corresponding to distinct eigenvalues, then $x$ and $y$ are orthogonal.

  (b) Show more generally that this holds whenever $A$ is normal, i.e.,
  $A A^* = A^* A$.

#problem[
  Let $A$ be the $n times n$ real symmetric, tridiagonal matrix with $0$
  on the main diagonal and $1$ on the superdiagonal (and hence, by
  symmetry, $1$ on the subdiagonal as well):

  $
    A = mat(
      0, 1, 0, dots, 0;
      1, 0, 1, dots, 0;
      0, 1, 0, dots, 0;
      dots.v, dots.v, dots.v, dots.down, dots.v;
      0, 0, 0, dots.c, 0
    ).
  $

  Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of $A$.

#solution[
  For this problem, I present the path arriving at the solution for me to show what are some likely mistakes in such a solution.

  Initially, I considered the $n=4$ case, which could be eliminated to a permutation matrix. The $n=5$ case cannot as elimination produces one row of $0$'s. Thus, I conjectured that $vb(A)$ is singular if $n$ is odd. However, I falsely assumed that the elimination preserves eigenvalues and eigenvectors, then making false claims.

  Upon realizing that error, I still believed that solving the characteristic equation is unnecessary. Notice that $ vb(A) = vb(J)_n + vb(J)^top_n, $ where $vb(J)_n$ is the Jordan block of size $n$. Hence, I made the following flawed argument.

  Notice $vb(J)$ is similar to $vb(J)^top$ as the eigenvalues of $vb(J)$ is given by $det (vb(J) - lambda vb(I)) = 0$, and $(vb(J) - lambda vb(I))^top = vb(J)^top - lambda vb(I)$. The two equations are identical as $det vb(T) = det vb(T)^top$, a fact that could be shown by showing $ D(vb(A)) = (det vb(A B))/(det vb(B)) $ satisfies the defining properties of the determinant. Then, $ cases(vb(J x) = lambda vb(x), vb(J^top x) = lambda vb(x)) ==> vb((J + J^top)x = lambda vb(x)) $ as $vb(J)$ and $vb(J)^top$ share eigenvalues. Then, because $vb(J)$ has the only eigenvalue $0$ and the only independent eigenvector $mat(a; 0; 0; dots.v)$, that is the final answer.

  However, the problem with this proof was already hinted in $18.06$ lectures but I did not note down thinking I will not make this mistake. the eigenvectors of $vb(J)$ and $vb(J)^top$ are not necessarily the same. This argument falls apart.

  At this point, I resigned to solving the characteristic equation. First, Notice that by the cofactor expansion of the determinant, @eqn:cofactorexpansion, $ det vb(A)_n = - det vb(A)_(n-2). $ Also, $det vb(A)_0 = 0$ and $det vb(A)_1 = -1$, justifying the previous conjecture that $vb(A)$ is singular iff $n$ is odd. 

  Let the characteristic polynomial for $vb(A) in RR^(n times n)$ be $p_n (lambda)$. With the cofactor expansion again, $ p_n = -lambda p_(n-1) - p_(n-2), quad p_1 = -lambda, quad p_2 = lambda^2 - 1. $ To solve this recursion the linear algebra way, let $ vb(u)_n:= mat(p_(n+1); p_(n)). $ The recursion becomes $ vb(u)_n = mat(-lambda, -1; 1, 0) vb(u)_(n-1). $ The eigenvalues of $mat(-lambda, -1; 1, 0)$ are $ mu_1 := (-lambda + sqrt(lambda^2 - 4))/2, quad mu_2:= (-lambda -sqrt(lambda^2 - 4))/2, $ corresponding to eigenvectors $ vb(v)_mu = mat(mu; 1). $ The initial condition gives $ vb(u)_1 = mat(lambda^2 - 1;-lambda) = c_1 mat(mu_1, 1) + c_2 mat(mu_2, 1). $ Solving gives $ (c_1, c_2) = (mu_1^2/(mu_1 - mu_2), - mu_2^2/(mu_1 - mu_2)). $ Thus, $ vb(u)_n = c_1 mu_1^(n-1) mat(mu_1; 1) + c_2 mu_2^(n-1) mat(mu_2; 1). $ Giving the Binet style $ p_n = (mu_1^(n+1) - mu_2^(n+1))/(mu_1 - mu_2). $

  Let $B$ be the $n times n$ real skew-symmetric, tridiagonal matrix with
  $0$ on the main diagonal and $1$ on the superdiagonal (and hence, by
  skew-symmetry, $-1$ on the subdiagonal):

  $
    B = mat(
